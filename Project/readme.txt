Hello. You are currently looking at the read me text file for a student game named (This Is Living?)

This is a python 2.7.6 project for the Rutgers University Computational Thinking course.

There is only one primary file for this program, which is called ThisIsLiving.py, the others are leftover coding review files.

This project is based on the lives of the homeless, and the struggles they face on a day to day basis.
The media the game is based off of it a text based game, where you will have to make decisions on how
you will spend your time and energy in order to simply survive. At first, I thought I would create
a profile system in order to save the players progress. I had a large amount of ideas I wanted
to add to add more complexity to the game system. However I eventually scrapped that idea due
to the complexity of creating save files, and the fear of somehow creating an infinite loop
of saved files. So instead I went with the system of, one run, one life. The player cannot
save, or load, because in reality, nobody can go back to make their own decisions.

The player will have to:
manage their Health, Wellness, Hunger, Thirst, and Rest in order to not succumb to the elements.
The more that some stats are neglected, the worse the players health will become.
Surviving on the streets are difficult, especially when trying to keep their own needs in check.

The goal of the player is to survive the streets and earn enough money to get out of there.
The flat amount of cash needed is $100, to buy necessities and to get a bus ticket to leave the city.
