This is a model for the kinds of comments I wanted you guys to create and how to document your code. It's clear that you're being kind to your future self (and me!) in being descriptive about not just what you're doing but why. The code itself is clean and, though I didn't test it or scrutinize it line by line, it is clearly a step toward a working project. Great work. I'm happy to talk in person about what next steps you can take to initialize the game itself.
