# Comments
Good comments throughout, including at the tops of major blocks and similar places in the code.

# Code Quality
The code was clean and well-written and ran without error. It would have been good to encapsulate some of the variable changes in a modular function rather than some of the long, similar blocks you have, but that function might have been as hard to write as retyping the changes manually. I'll also say to think about setting some limits on user input or allowing them to go back from one menu to another: the game let me sleep for 1,000 hours.

The experience of playing the game was grating and monotonous, which, here, is a compliment. I think you set out to do what you wanted.

# Ambition
This is a hugely ambitious project for a class assignment that you had comparatively little time to complete. Great work.
