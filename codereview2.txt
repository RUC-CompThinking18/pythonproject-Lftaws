Your code didn't run due to an indent error, so unfortunately you lose points for that. The code itself is strong, and you continued your pattern of writing code with strong, clear comments. The code itself seems like it would run without that one indentation error. Overall, this is good work: the code is clear and, aside from that one issue, without obvious error.
